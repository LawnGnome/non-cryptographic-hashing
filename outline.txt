FNV-1a
MurmurHash3
xxHash?
CRC32?
SBox?
SuperFastHash as an example of problems


Why:

Basic theory:
- Avalanche effect
  - Problem: input data that only varies on certain bits (eg ASCII text)
    00011000
    00010000
    00001000

    000xx000
- Mixing function
- Well chosen primes
  - Multiplying or dividing/modulo by a prime reduces collisions

Considerations:
- Endianness: some functions only support one or the other (or, more commonly, give different results on each)
- Memory use
- CPU use

Rating:
- Memory and CPU provide useful metrics
- Distribution of results
- Collisions
  - Those two are related, but subtly different: distribution is important when building hash tables, for instance
